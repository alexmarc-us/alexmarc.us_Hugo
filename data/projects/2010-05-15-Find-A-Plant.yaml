  The Connecticut College Arboretum has a large (over 6,000 organisms) sample of plants on its campus.  As part of the effort to catalog and organize these plants in a publicly-accessible manner, I created a web-based plant database.

  The <a href="http://www.conncoll.edu/the-arboretum/plant-collections/find-a-plant/" target="_blank">Find A Plant page</a> utilizes a MySQL database of plant information and JavaScript with XML to display all query-matching plants located on the campus.  The database is maintained by the college&#8217;s Arboretum staff approximately once every year.  Administrative tasks are performed via a custom admin panel with features to add, modify, and delete plant entries, as well as upload CSV database files.

  The database is still in use to this day, serving the Connecticut College campus and surrounding area with information about the surrounding plant life.
