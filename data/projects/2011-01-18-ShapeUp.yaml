  ShapeUp was my first professional tech job outside of my college environment, and it launched me into a career of software engineering across a the stack of technologies.  Their activity-tracking social platform utilizes user participation and organization-level events to encourage healthy employee lifestyles.

  During my time at ShapeUp I was tasked with a number of different projects.  Each contributed a user-facing component, and I was responsible for contributing to the entire product from inception, to definition, to design, to development and delivery.

  <h3>Don't Forget List</h3>

  To make participation easier, I helped code an MVC widget of PHP/MySQL-driven checkbox reminders.  The Don't Forget list's intuitive UI and modern HTML/CSS make it a vital tool to ShapeUp's platform.
