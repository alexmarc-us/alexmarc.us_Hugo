  OMNI Retail Group provides a platform which enables retailers and manufacturers to serve shoppers with an intuitive, engaging and consistent product discovery experience across millions of SKUS and thousands of product categories.  It offers cross-analysis around online shopping habits and in-store purchases.

  During my time at OMNI I contributed a critical client page plugin to their eCommerce analysis suite, consisting of RequireJS-optimized front-end JavaScript code with a NodeJS middle tier and AWS backend.  This code was deployed across numberous Fortune 500 client retail sites and provides in-depth analytic data.
