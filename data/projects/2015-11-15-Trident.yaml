  During my time as a Senior Developer and Team Lead at <a href="http://www.level11.com/">Level 11</a>, I played an integral role in the ideation, build, delivery, and support of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayfinding" target="_blank">Wayfinding system</a> for Carnival Cruise Lines.  This system is a key part of the <a href="https://www.ocean.com/ocean/" target="_blank">OCEAN</a> user experience aboard Carnival's Medallion-Class ships, and is known to guests as Ocean NAV.

  During the conceptualization of Wayfinding, I ran a formal research study of map comprehension by working with a dedicated design team to develop functional mocks, feature trials, and UX test suites.  To identify optimal solutions for the proposed designs I conducted technical explorations to discover available technologies.

  In preparation for <a href="https://www.wired.com/2017/01/carnival-ocean-medallion-wearable/" target="_blank">CES 2017</a>, I developed the proof-of-concept Wayfinding Beta in web technologies such as WebGL, Node.js, and React.  This demonstration was presented to members of the press and the project was mentioned in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Im7xJeHrvkM" target="_blank">Arnold Donald's keynote address</a>.

  As the project moved from demonstration to production, the tech stack was switched to <a href="https://unity3d.com/" target="_blank">Unity3D</a>.  At the same time, I was asked to take on the Team Lead role for Wayfinding and entrusted with its delivery.

  In this new leadership position, I guided a team of 6 developers to implement, test, and deploy Wayfinding.  In November 2017 the Ocean NAV project was successfully delivered to Carnival's first Medallion-Class ship.  Its ability to guide guests through labyrinth-like ships and provide insight into activities has been a highlight of the OCEAN experience.
