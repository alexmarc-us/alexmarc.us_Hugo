  Level 11 is a consulting company which focuses on delivering user experience and software development as requested by its clients.

  To anticipate the needs of new clients and provide a showcase of its impressive technology capabilities, Level 11 entrusted me with the resources to conceptualize, design, plan, and implement internal tools that will provide clients with ready-made solutions to hard problems.  This effort is a similar pre-implementation pattern as <a href="http://www.level11.com/level-11-blog/2016/12/26/location-services" target="_blank">previous work in the location service field</a>.

  Leading a team and architecting a full software solution, with the trust of a strong executive team, is definitely a highlight of my technology career.
