  Historically Level 11 has been a traditional consulting company, serving client needs as laid out by the client.  However, to meet the needs of a evolving market and remain competitive, development efforts to implement and license internal products have been spun up.

  Level 11 entrusted me with the resources to conceptualize, design, plan, and implement internal tools that will provide clients with ready-made solutions to hard problems.  The development is in the same realm as <a href="http://www.level11.com/level-11-blog/2016/12/26/location-services" target="_blank">previous work in the location service field</a>.

  Leading a team and architecting a solution, with the trust of a strong executive team, is definitely a highlight of my technology career.
