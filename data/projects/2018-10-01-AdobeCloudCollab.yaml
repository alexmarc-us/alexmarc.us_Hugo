  I joined Adobe in 2018 because I believe in their mission of empowering creativity.  I have been using Adobe products since my first computer sometime around 2001, so this opportunity was something of a dream job.

  Within the Adobe Creative Cloud Experience group, I make components which enable collaboration between creatives and the people they create for.  We make use of a huge array of cloud infrastructure, as well as web and native technologies.

  It is inspiring to implement a new way of working for people who will use this software hundreds of times per day, and I am grateful for the chance.
