  <p>I volunteer for the Manette Neighborhood Coalition (MNC) as the <a href="http://manetteneighborhoodcoalition.org/board-members/" target="_blank">Technology Officer</a>, and as such my first task was to revamp their out-of-date website.  Working alongside my board members, I created a brand identity and developed a Wordpress site.</p>

  <p>The logo reflects the community we live in, which has a proud identity stemming from the separation between Manette and downtown Bremerton.  This separation exists because of the Manette Bridge, and so that pride is reflected in the bridge's feature in our logo.</p>

  <p>The Wordpress site, hosted at <a href="http://manette.org/" target="_blank">manette.org</a>, provides a central location for our community's events and news.  It includes calendar functionality which allows us to plan events and notify our neighbors of what's coming up.  We also use Wordpress's default posting functionality to handle news and updates.</p>
