In response to this attack, TJX implemented a number of new security features and regulations at the stores and corporate offices.

During these updates, I was employed to assist coordinating the updates between the store systems and corporate systems. I worked remotely with on-site techs to update firewalls and other security devices dealing heavily with Cisco hardware and command line interfaces. I learned the intricacies of IT security, and the level of sophistication required to avoid such attacks.
