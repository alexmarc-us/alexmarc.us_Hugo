[<img class="alignleft wp-image-805 size-medium" src="http://alexmarc.us/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/AM20-300x15.png" alt="AlexMarc.us 2.0 Preview" width="300" height="15" />][1]The second version of AlexMarc.us was a major shift from [version 1.0][2], both in its design and layout.  Pulling back from the experimental and theoretically endless expanse of pixels in 1.0, I created a minimal and almost completely image-free experience.  In the second version I also began utilizing WordPress as a content management system.

My original statement on the site is as follows:

> [The site] is a design completely of my own creation. It is run on the [WordPress][3]{.right} content management system with an entirely custom set of modern HTML/CSS/PHP templates integrating the posts and sections you see above into a logical, clean layout.
> 
> While developing this site I tested several layouts before deciding that content is king. I came up with a layout that is uncompromisingly dedicated to content, which relates the sections, categories, and posts entirely through words. The only image-like items I allowed in the design are the small ASCII arrows, which offer a more immediate understanding of the site’s navigation.

AlexMarc.us version 1.0 was [launched on September 5, 2010][4] and has been reproduced <a href="http://alexmarc.us/AM2.0/" target="_blank">here</a>, but please note that the information there is largely out-of-date.
