The multi-threaded server receives connections from clients, and stores their information in a database containing the users&#8217; profile.  Then it regularly checks the users&#8217; presence, and updates online users with a list of online clients.

The multi-threaded client sends login data to the server, indicating its online presence.  It then waits to receive data from other clients, or send data to other clients, via a P2P interface.  The client software utilizes a command line-style UI.

The ChatDev code is available via GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/optimarcusprime/ChatDev" target="_blank">https://github.com/optimarcusprime/ChatDev</a>.
