[ShapeUp][2]‘s activity-tracking social platform relies on a social network which encourages users to participate in teams and  exercise competitions within their organization.

I was the lead developer for a re-code of the supporter search page, implementing live search results and one-click supporter links.  These results are displayed actively as the user enters a query. Results can be further defined by interest and location.
