The People You May Know widget algorithmically generates potential supporter suggestions based on user activities and interest compatibility. This widget works within ShapeUp’s scoped organization and privacy settings.

I was the lead developer for this widget, and worked closely with analysts to establish the optimal algorithm for supporter compatibility.  I then coded the query in MySQL and used PHP to display the results.
