This tracking calendar is the core of the ShapeUp platform, allowing users to track their fitness-related metrics on a daily or weekly basis.  Metrics are either standard, for competitions and charts, or customized to the participant&#8217;s goals.

I developed a number of improvements and fixes for this component, either initiated by the product management team or in response to a technical issue.  Much of the calendar&#8217;s functionality involves asynchronous database changes.  Active widgets on the page are updated on-the-fly with averages, ranks, and more.
