The WordPress blog is a custom developed theme based on [Foodie][2].  The design team came up with a number of challenges, which I met head-on, including:

  * Custom sidebar image menu
  * Social media integration
  * Custom category icons for posts
  * Email list subscription
  * Blog setup and administration

The result of my efforts, along with those of the design team, is a beautiful and functional blog experience to help drive Sur La Table&#8217;s web presence and SEO.
