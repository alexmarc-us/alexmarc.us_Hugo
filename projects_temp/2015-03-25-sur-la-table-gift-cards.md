Their previous design required navigation to several different pages for different types of gift cards, which was both inefficient and frustrating to the user.

In the <a href="http://www.surlatable.com/category/CAT-11149/" target="_blank">new gift card page design</a>, we focused on making the card selection as easy and intuitive as possible.  It allows the user to choose from a variety of options including virtual vs traditional cards, amount, design, and personalization.  It also has a preview panel that shows exactly what the user will receive.

The feedback for the new gift card page has been tremendous.  Users have praised it as a large improvement over the previous option and as one of the better gift card experiences on the web.
