[<img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-937" src="http://alexmarc.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/SLT_PDP-138x300.jpg" alt="Sur La Table Product Detail Page" width="138" height="300" />][1][Sur La Table][2]&#8216;s product detail page (PDP) served online shoppers for almost a decade, and was in desperate need of a makeover.  During my two years at SLT I had developed a strong understanding of their eCommerce needs and design strategies, and so I was made the lead internal developer for the redesign project.

Fitting with SLT&#8217;s new look and feel in 2015, a clean and interactive design was required.  Working alongside a team of designers and marketing strategists, I contributed a number of interface suggestions until a fully fleshed-out UI was decided upon.

I was given the full responsibility of coding the PDP front-end.  Developing the product detail page of a major eCommerce site requires special attention paid to cross-browser compatibility, in addition to extensive QA and user acceptance testing.  Utilizing modern HTML standards, CSS techniques, and JavaScript libraries, I was able to construct a page that not only renders reliably, but also presents an appealing and intuitive interface.
